Project requirements
--------------------
- [x] Add full CRUD functionality for types of events to be logged. For instance, in a bird-watching application, a user might add "Spotted Sandpiper" to indicate a viewing of that kind of bird.
- [x] Allow users to increment the event by one when there is a viewing, a play of the game, or so on. Users should also be able to decrement an event (for instance, if they made a mistake).

Additional exploration
----------------------
- [x] Add a background. Also make the background scale with the size of the display.
- [ ] Add a multiple pages function into the site for organization purposes.
