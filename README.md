An app used for keeping track of costumes

Description
----------------
In this project users can create costumes of any character they can think of. They can add a price, the size, and the brand of the costume along with other information, including a picture! Users are also able to create individual parts of a costume and add these parts to a costume's page, like say a pair of boots on a Wolverine costume.

Setup/installation instructions
---------------------
1. You will need Node.js and npm to run this project properly. I recommend looking [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for more information.
2. Download the zip file from the green dropdown menu with the words < > Code on it.
3. Unzip the file to a folder of your choice.
4. Open the folder you just unzipped and copy the address to the folder.
5. Open Command Prompt. You can easily find it on Windows by using the SEARCH button at the bottom left of your screen and typing Command into the searchbar.
6. To install the needed Node Modules you'll need to navigate to the project folder. In your Command Prompt type `cd` + Space, and then paste the address you copied earlier.
7. run the command `npm install` in the command prompt window to install the necessary files to run the project.
8. run the command `npm audit fix` to get rid of the errors that show up.
9. Once the files are done installing, run the command `npm start` in the command prompt window to start the project.
